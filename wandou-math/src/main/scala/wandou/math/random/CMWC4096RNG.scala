/**
 * <p>A Java version of George Marsaglia's
 * <a href="http://school.anhb.uwa.edu.au/personalpages/kwessen/shared/Marsaglia03.html">Complementary
 * Multiply With Carry (CMWC) RNG</a>.
 * This is a very fast PRNG with an extremely long period (2^131104).  It should be used
 * in preference to the {@link MersenneTwisterRNG} when a very long period is required.</p>
 *
 * <p>One potential drawback of this RNG is that it requires significantly more seed data than
 * the other RNGs provided by Uncommons Maths.  It requires just over 16 kilobytes, which may
 * be a problem if your are obtaining seed data from a slow or limited entropy source.
 * In contrast, the Mersenne Twister requires only 128 bits of seed data.</p>
